# NOTE that this exercise is a bit more advanced and un-assited.

## TASK 1 ##
# Open the data in files Data_AlcoholConsumption.xlsx and Data_AdultLiteracy.xlsx 
# in R. Note that you have to either transform them into .txt files, or find a 
# package with a function that can open xlsx files. These files contain data on 
# literaty (% of people >15 years old) per country per year, and similar data 
# for consumption of alcohol (average per adult).

## TASK 2 ##
# Choose a recent year and 10 countries of your interest, and make a barplot in 
# which you compare literacy rates between the countries.

## TASK 3 ##
# Make a similar barplot for alcohol comsumption and save it as a jpeg or pdf 
# file. 

## TASK 4 ##
# Choose a recent year for the literacy dataset that has a good amount of data, 
# and a similar year for the alcohol dataset. Now make a scatterplot relating 
# the two variables. Note that the names of the countries need to match in both
# datasets. Some countries might be in one dataset but not the other, and might 
# need to be removed

## TASK 5 ##
# Use the function lm to fit a regression to this relationship, saving the 
# results into an object. Now, use the function summary on that object to print
# a summary of the results on the screen.
